==================== How to Run in UG Lab =========================
Step1: Run makefile

make


Step2: Run MazewarServer
Note that our MazewarServer takes 1 mandatory argument and 1 optional
argument as following:
	java MazewarServer PORT_NUMBER [NUM_PLAYERS]

If NUM_PLAYERS is not provided, by default it is set to 4 people.


Step3: Run Mazewar (client)

	java Mazewar HOST_NAME PORT_NUMBER

Note 
	1) If server is not running client will prompt you with following
		message and retries to connect to server every 3 seconds
		
		$ java Mazewar localhost 11816
		Trying to connect to server...
		Could not connect to server.. will try again in 3 seconds
		Could not connect to server.. will try again in 3 seconds

	2) If server doesn't have number of required players yet, 
	 	you will be prompted with following message

	 	$ java Mazewar localhost 11816
		Trying to connect to server...
		Waiting for other players to join...

	3) Upon providing existing username when joining game,
		the client will be asked to provide with other username.

Step4: Enjoy the game!


==================== What we have done ========================
We have completed everything as guided in Lab 2 handout.
Dynamic joins/leavings are not yet implemented as it's not
requirement for Lab 2 yet. We are willing to implement this 
feature on next phase.
