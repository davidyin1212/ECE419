==================== How to Run in UG Lab =========================
Step1: Run makefile

make


Step2: Run Mazewar Naming Server
Note that our MazewarServer takes 1 mandatory argument and 1 optional
argument as following:
	java NamingServer PORT_NUMBER



Step3: Run Mazewar (client)

	java Mazewar NAMING_SERVER_HOSTNAME NAMING_SERVER_PORT_NUMBER

Note 

	1) If we don't have enough number of required players yet, 
		game won't be started until we have 4 players.

	2) Upon providing existing username when joining game,
		the client will be asked to provide with other username.

Step4: When game starts, you can kill NamingService and will not affect 
	existing game.


==================== What we have done ========================
We have handled everything as guided in handout except for bonus tasks.
